# Semantic-Bus
semantic data transformation &amp; semantic container crawling

2 Goals
- transform data betwen heterogenus ontologies
  - multiple source protocole
  - multiple destination protocole
  - data transformation without coding
  - data completion from linked field
  - data agregation from multiple source
  - geo data completion from adresse
  - middle database for performance
  - support new record mention to propagate information across multiple neighbour node (see web mention)
- crawl data betwen semantic node
  - index neighbour node data (id and essential field) for the same ontology to perform search (see linked data fragments)
